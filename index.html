      <h1>Sabrina Robinson</h1>
      <p>
        Back-end software engineer with web development, code-base testing, and
         leadership experience. I have a special love for modular, scalable
         software that can be optimized and tested to achieve peak performance.
         When I'm not getting my thrills from diving into novel problem spaces
         to solve real-world problems through innovation, I can be found rock
         climbing, running, hiking, and enjoying a good cup of joe (coffee).
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm most experienced in using Ruby on Rails, Postgres, and ActiveRecord
        to create RESTful APIs and service-oriented architectures (SOA) on the
        backend.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feel free to reach out! I am always available and excited to chat about
        tech, coffee (joe), the outdoors, or just to say hello!
      </p>
